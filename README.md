# PhD Project

This repo contains source files for my PhD project titled, _"Mathematical & Computational Modelling of Fluid Flow through Porous Media"_, at University College Dublin.

## Introduction

- a library for
    * single phase flow through porous media
    * multiphase flow through porous media (relative permeability and capillary pressure)

- solvers created
    * stokesFoam : a stokes solver based on the simpleFoam algorithm 

- tutorials
     * flow_past_sphere_wedge : solving stokes flow past a sphere
